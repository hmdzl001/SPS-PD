windows.wndstory.sewers=The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more dangerous. The city sends guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above, but they are slowly failing.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
windows.wndstory.prison=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
windows.wndstory.caves=The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
windows.wndstory.city=Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
windows.wndstory.halls=In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...
windows.wndstory.sokoban1=Finally, I start my adventure for my hometown.\n\nI went to tower, an old magic school, was famous of its laboratory and library.\n\nAfter that, I hear a story about weird box, deadly traps and hidden treasure.\n\nI know what should I do.\n\n-Otiluke, 1345 in empire
windows.wndstory.sokoban2=I complete that quest, and find something. A treasure box surrounded by strange energies.\n\nI open it in tower, and find a map in there. .It seems like... a co-ordinate, and point to a small island. I hope my Dolye stone is still can work...\n\n-Otiluke, 1348 in empire
windows.wndstory.sokoban3=Kill that mirror spent lots of times, but I find that artifact at last.\n\nBased report by laboratory, that glasses can open a portal to another world. There are some unknown creatures lived in there.\n\nI am ready to enter this portal.\n\n-Otiluke, 1355 in empire
windows.wndstory.sokoban4=I can't remember how many time I spend in translate that language, but at last, I success.\n\n\nThis world is create by zot, one powerful void leader. He was try to ruled every world, but he failed. With the help of different hero in different world, zot lost his power and can't move anymore.\n\nThen, I have a great idea. If I control that zot, I will have enough energy to save my hometown.\n\nI will do that! But first of all, I need enter his fortress\n\n-Otiluke, 1361 in empire maybe
windows.wndstory.safelevel=The seller: shopkeeper\nThe buyer: hero\n\nthe seller and buyer, based on equality, voluntariness and negotiated consensus, hereby conclude the following agreement on the purchase and sale of commodity house:\nSeller will sell sweet house to Buyer.\nBuyer will give Seller 1500 golds.\nThis Agreement is in duplicate and has the same legal effect.
