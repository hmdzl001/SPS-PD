infos.newdocument.story_guide.title=Introduction to SPS mainland
infos.newdocument.story_guide.intro.title=Basic introduction
infos.newdocument.story_guide.intro.body=Hello, welcome to The TOWER test 1.0. I'm coconut.\n\nYou are reading this book is an introduction to SPS land! This book contains all kinds of situations and crises in SPS land. Please check it in detail before participating in the test.\n\nThis is just a test. All battles are completed by the characters you control, so you don't have to worry about any physical damage. However, some extreme actions may activate the character's sleep thought. Please be careful in order to test safety.\n\nThe TOWER will prepare rich rewards for all testers, so:\n\nLet's start the test!
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tower.title=The TOWER
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tower.body=The TOWER is the most powerful camp on SPS land, located in the center of SPS land.\n\nAlthough the control scope is small, we have expanded the space area and built various environments and ecosystems through magic and scientific and technological means.\n\nEvery once in a while, we will recruit students and volunteers from other groups of SPS land and provide them with rich remuneration.\n\nWe simulated various weapons inside the tower for testers, including magic, technology and weapons of different times.\n\n(high --- destroyed, --- stored --- missing)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.def.title=The BASTION
infos.newdocument.story_guide.def.body=The BASTION are second only to The TOWER.\n\nThe BASTION is located in the northwest of SPS land, occupies most of the area of SPS land, and controls part of the external ocean. Based on the vast occupied area, The BASTION basically includes all environmental types and biological types in SPS land\n\nAt the same time, the racial relations within The BASTION are very harmonious, and creatures of different faiths can get along normally.\n\n(I don't believe that the interior of The BASTION is monolithic. The investigation results of the dark sewer incident of The BASTION have not been released so far. We must prevent disasters.)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.palace.title=The PALACE
infos.newdocument.story_guide.palace.body=The PALACE is located in the northwest of SPS land and built on the northwest mountains.\n\nThe PALACE business is very developed, and its mountains also contain a lot of treasures and relics. However, most of the resources are monopolized by the high-level palace, so the gap between the rich and the poor in The PALACE is serious and there are many families.\n\nWe once dug a strange cave in the northwest mountains, in which there will be some things and monsters we have never seen before. According to the agreement between The TOWER and The PALACE, we have sent commissioners to control it.\n\nDolya Town is also a good tourist destination. I hope you can relax there in the form of test.
infos.newdocument.story_guide.ruins.title=The RUINS
infos.newdocument.story_guide.ruins.body=The RUINS is located in the southeast of SPS land, with large forests and lakes and hidden areas.\n\nThe RUINS also provide enough food for the SPS land.\n\nMaybe we need some cultural atmosphere of The RUINS, where there are some traditional festivals.\n\nWe suspect that there is a tomb hidden in The RUINS. Recently, there have been frequent sightings of undead there.
infos.newdocument.story_guide.horn.title=The HORN
infos.newdocument.story_guide.horn.body=The HORN is located in the south of SPS land.\n\nThe HORN has the largest prison and arena in SPS land.\n\nIf you want to try your strength, you can go there.\n\n(recently, there are dead bodies disappearing inside the prison. We should be careful in combination with the death witness report of The RUINS)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tribe.title=The TRIBE
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tribe.body=The TRIBE is located between The HORN, The TOWER and The BASTION, and exists as a buffer zone.\n\nDwarf city was built within The TRIBE.\n\nIt is said that sometimes abnormal sounds come from the underground of The TRIBE. We should be vigilant.\n\n(the sky is strange. something will happen)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.homeless.title=the homeless
infos.newdocument.story_guide.homeless.body=There's nothing to say, just homeless.\n\nMost vagrants wander in uncontrolled areas.\n\n(homeless.)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.overseas.title=oversea
infos.newdocument.story_guide.overseas.body=We can't detect the situation overseas, but something does come from the another land.\n\nThe BASTION has solved some problems for us, but that is not enough.\n\nSome alien prisoners say they come from there, but they can't describe the information of that.\n\n(there should be someone lived in there, but we still haven't any reported of it)
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tester.title=About tester
infos.newdocument.story_guide.tester.body=The character you control is one of the few elites on SPS mainland. All their combat memories and their bodies are saved in The TOWER.\n\nwarrior from The HORN, mages from The TOWER, rogue from The PALACE, hunter from The RUINS, performer from The BASTION, soldier from overseas, homeless follower, and ascetic from The TRIBE.\n\nEach of them is the existence of turning the tide. The TOWER spent a lot of effort to collect them. Please control them carefully.\n\nThis test aims to discover the threats faced in SPS land in advance and create advanced anti disaster soldiers at the same time. Remember, your responsibility is great.

infos.newdocument.story_guide.damagetype.title=Damage Type
infos.newdocument.story_guide.damagetype.body=In SPS land, there have 3 damage type, melee damage, magic damage, pure  damage.
